### About Me

I hold a Master's Degree in Sociology and have been teaching statistics off-and-on for 10 years, but recently decided I wanted to get back to building projects of my own. I'm enrolled in TripleTen's 10 month data science bootcamp and hope to make a switch to a full time data science role in October. I'm looking to build data science projects, connect with other data scientists, and advance my career.
