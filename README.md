### About Me

I hold a Master's Degree in Sociology and have been teaching statistics off-and-on for 10 years, and I recently decided to go back to school for Data Science. I'm enrolled in TripleTen's 10 month data science bootcamp and am currently learning Python and building Machine Learning projects.
